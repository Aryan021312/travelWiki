                Nepal stands as a unique example of a secular and multicultural nation where diverse festivals are
                joyfully celebrated within communities. In Nepal, individuals of varying religious backgrounds coexist
                in the same neighborhoods and societies, fostering a spirit of unity as they come together to share in
                the celebrations of a multitude of festivals, thus sharing their joys, happiness, and sorrows as a
                harmonious whole.
                Dashain (Nepali: दशैं; Daśãi, also Baḍādaśhãin बडादशैं or Bijayā Daśamī Nepali: बिजया दशमी) is the
                15-day-long festival and holidays of Nepal.[2][3] It is the longest and the most auspicious festival in
                the Nepalese annual calendar, celebrated by Nepalese Hindu people throughout the globe. It is not only
                the longest festival of the country, but also the one which is most anticipated. As one of the popular
                countries, Nepal has its Hindu festival as Dashain. The festival falls in September or October, starting
                from the shukla paksha (bright lunar fortnight) of the month of Ashvin and ending on purnima, the full
                moon. Among the 10 days for which it is celebrated, the most important days are the first, seventh,
                eighth, ninth and the tenth, but tenth day is very important [4][5] Throughout the country Shakti is
                worshiped in all her manifestations. This festival is also known for its emphasis on the family
                gatherings, as well as on a renewal of community ties.[3] People return from all parts of the world, as
                well as different parts of the country, to celebrate together.[3] All government offices, educational
                institutions and other private offices remain closed during the festival and holidays period.

            <h5>Significance</h5>
            <p class="description">
                Dashain symbolizes the victory of good over evil.

                For followers of Shaktism, it represents the bare victory of the goddess, Shakti. In Hindu mythology,
                the demon Mahishasura had created terror in the devaloka (the world where gods live ) but Durga killed
                the demon.[6][7][8] The first nine days of Dashain symbolizes the battle which took place between the
                different manifestations of Durga and Mahishasura. The tenth day is the day when Durga finally defeated
                him. For other Hindus, this festival symbolizes the victory of Rama over Ravana as recounted in the
                Ramayana.

                In Nepal all Hindu ethnic groups celebrate this festival with their own variation. Among the Newars, it
                is known as Swanti. The festival is celebrated from Trayodashi of Kartik Krishna to Kartik Shukla
                Dwitiya every year. Tihar in general signifies the festival of lights, where diyas are lit both inside
                and outside the houses to make it illuminate at night. The five-day festival is considered to be of
                great importance as it shows reverence to not just the humans and the Gods, but also to the animals like
                crow, cow and dog, who maintain an intense relationship with the humans. People make patterns on the
                floor of living rooms or courtyards using materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or
                flower petals outside of their house, called "Rangoli" which is meant to be sacred welcoming areas for
                the Hindu deities.[9] During the celebrations gamblers are found in the streets and some gamblers are
                known to make extreme bets such as staking their properties and some times their own daughter and wives
                jewelries.[10]
